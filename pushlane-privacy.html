      <section>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how the <strong>Pushlane</strong> mobile application
          (the “App”) handles your information. The App may be distributed through the
          <strong>Google Play Store</strong> and the <strong>Apple App Store</strong>
          (together, the “App Stores”).
        </p>
        <p>
          By installing or using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
          If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>1. Data we process</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Data stored locally on your device</h3>
        <p>
          Pushlane is designed to work <strong>primarily offline and locally</strong>. The
          following data is stored <strong>only on your device</strong> and is not sent to
          servers controlled by the developer:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your tasks, projects, routines, and related content (titles, descriptions, dates, etc.)</li>
          <li>Your daily score and completion history</li>
          <li>Your display preferences (themes, language, views, etc.)</li>
          <li>Your notification and reminder settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These items remain under your control. They are not synchronized to a
          Pushlane-owned cloud service and are not voluntarily shared by the App with
          third parties, unless otherwise described below.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Technical data</h3>
        <p>
          To operate properly on your device and through the App Stores, certain
          <strong>technical data</strong> may be processed by the operating system or
          platform, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
          <li>Language and region settings</li>
          <li>Network connection status</li>
          <li>
            Platform identifiers (for example, an advertising identifier provided by the
            operating system or app store, if advertising SDKs are used)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These items are typically handled by Android, iOS, and any third-party services
          integrated in the App, under their own privacy policies.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. How we use your data</h2>
        <p>
          The data you enter in Pushlane is used to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Display your <strong>daily task list</strong> and <strong>score</strong></li>
          <li>Mark tasks as completed when you swipe them and update your score</li>
          <li>Organize your work into projects, routines, and other views</li>
          <li>Schedule and show <strong>local notifications</strong> and reminders</li>
          <li>Remember your interface preferences (theme, language, layout, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not use your personal data to build a marketing profile, and we do not
          track you across other apps or websites.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. In-app purchases and subscriptions</h2>
        <p>
          Over time, Pushlane will offer <strong>in-app purchases and subscriptions</strong>
          to unlock premium features.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Payments are processed by the <strong>App Stores</strong> (Google Play Store and
            Apple App Store) using their in-app purchase systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            The developer may receive limited information related to your purchase status
            (for example: product identifier, subscription type, renewal date, active/expired
            status), but <strong>never</strong> your full payment details such as credit card numbers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The App may also use a <strong>third-party subscription management service</strong>
          to validate and sync purchase status across devices. In that case, the service may
          process:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A technical identifier linked to your store account or device</li>
          <li>Information necessary to verify purchases (product IDs, transaction dates, status)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These third-party services operate under their own privacy policies, which we
          encourage you to review.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Advertising and third-party services</h2>
        <p>
          Pushlane may integrate <strong>advertising, analytics, or other third-party SDKs</strong>
          in order to support the App (for example, to show ads or to understand general
          usage patterns).
        </p>
        <p>Depending on the services used, these third parties may collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Advertising identifiers or similar device identifiers</li>
          <li>Technical information (device model, OS version, language, country/region)</li>
          <li>Aggregated usage data (number of sessions, session duration, generic events)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In regions where it is required by law (for example, in the European Union),
          you may be shown a consent screen allowing you to choose between personalized
          and non-personalized ads, or to opt out of certain data uses where applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pushlane does not have access to your individual advertising profile. The
          developer receives only aggregated information, such as the number of ad
          impressions or estimated revenue.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Data sharing</h2>
        <p>
          We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share data only in the following situations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Service providers:</strong> with technical providers needed to deliver
            certain features (for example, in-app purchases, subscriptions, advertising,
            analytics), and only to the extent necessary for those services to work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal obligations:</strong> if required by law, regulation, or a valid
            request from a competent authority.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In all cases, we aim to limit the data shared to what is strictly necessary.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Data retention and deletion</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Local data on your device</h3>
        <p>
          All data you enter in Pushlane (tasks, projects, score, preferences, etc.) is
          stored <strong>only on your device</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>You can delete this data at any time by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deleting individual tasks or projects within the App, and/or</li>
          <li>Uninstalling the App from your device, which removes all associated local data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The developer does not maintain a backup or copy of your task data on personal
          servers.
        </p>

        <h3>6.2 Purchases and third-party services</h3>
        <p>
          Data required for managing purchases and subscriptions may be retained by the
          App Stores or by third-party services for as long as needed to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide and maintain your access to paid features</li>
          <li>Comply with legal, accounting, and anti-fraud obligations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Retention periods are determined by the respective providers according to their
          own policies.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take reasonable measures to protect the data processed by the App, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Relying on the operating system’s secure storage mechanisms</li>
          <li>Avoiding unnecessary transmission of your local task data to remote servers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, no system is perfectly secure. The security of your device (such as
          screen lock and encryption settings) also plays an important role in keeping
          your information safe.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Children</h2>
        <p>
          Pushlane is not specifically directed to children under the age of 13 and does
          not knowingly collect personal information from them. If a child uses the App,
          we recommend that it be under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>9. Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your country or region (for example, within the European Union),
          you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Right of access</li>
          <li>Right to rectification</li>
          <li>Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)</li>
          <li>Right to restriction of processing</li>
          <li>Right to object to certain processing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because Pushlane does not store your task data on its own servers, most of
          these rights can be exercised directly on your device by editing or deleting
          data in the App, or by uninstalling the App.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have questions about how these rights apply in your situation, you can
          contact us using the details below.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>10. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example when:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>New features are added to the App (such as cloud sync or new integrations)</li>
          <li>We change or add third-party services</li>
          <li>Legal or regulatory requirements evolve</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The most recent version will always be available via the link provided on the
          App’s listing in the App Stores and/or on the associated GitHub Page.
        </p>
